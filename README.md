# Word2VecJava
forked https://github.com/medallia/Word2VecJava just to include all dependencies and delete their broken build scripts and move things. It now works right away when you set classpath and add jar files in data/lib in eclipse. Their readme is in https://github.com/benrayfield/Word2VecJava/blob/master/data/com/medallia/word2vec/README.md
